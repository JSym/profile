### Monitoring Data Systems

**Design and implementation of bespoke solutions to collect, manage, analyse and report monitoring data.**

Getting the right information to the right people at the right time is a key part of effective programme management.  It enables you to make evidence-based decisions to deliver better programmes and better outcomes. Managing the data involved can be complex and time-consuming, but a well-planned system can ensure that data flows smoothly and meaningful information is available on demand.

Using serverless architecture which integrates third-party tools and existing operational systems, I deliver systems which are:

- **Appropriate and scalable:**  Building on existing systems and designed to meet your needs and capabilities. From simple business processes to complex requirements with highly variable programmes and multiple data sources

- **Complete:** End-to-end solutions which close the loop of the programme cycle by integrating business processes and multiple data sources to deliver useful data when and where it’s needed

- **Efficient and cost-effective:** Automated data flows and processing to reduce manual effort and free up resource for meaningful analysis and informed decision-making 

### Data Analysis and Reporting
**From discrete projects such as analysis for evaluations or research, to regular on-going reporting for organisational learning and accountability.**

From discrete, one-off projects to regular or on-going reporting, such as:

- Analysis and reporting **programme evaluations, research projects**, reporting to funders or external publication.

- Analysis of **operational and impact data** from internal, operational sources or external public datasets

- Design of **reports, dashboards, processes and datasets** for regular operational, management or external reporting

### Advice and Consultancy
**Design and implementation of monitoring frameworks. Advice on reporting structures and business processes for impact monitoring.**

Advice and consultancy on any aspect of impact monitoring, including:

- Reviewing, analysing and consolidating internal or external **reporting requirements**

- Reviewing or developing **business processes** around the collection, management or analysis of impact data

- Development of **monitoring frameworks**, either for specific projects/programmes or at an organisational level including designing appropriate measurement methodologies and processes

### Client: Amnesty International – Human Rights Education

### Project: Progress Report 2020 - Data analysis and validation

*December 2020 – March 2021*

The key deliverable of this project was to provide insights and analysis of data reported by Amnesty’s Human Rights Education (HRE) projects worldwide to inform the annual [HRE Progress Report for 2020](https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/pol32/4026/2021/en/).  I developed an interactive tool in PowerBI which included comparative analysis and visualisations alongside reporting by country, region, strategic goal and project, based on 5 years worth of historical data which I compiled, normalised and validated.  The tool provided the client with consistent, accurate and accessible reporting with uses beyond the initial scope of the project. 

In addition, I undertook descriptive analysis and commentary on trends, highlights and other findings to inform the final Progress Report, plus detailed reporting on data quality assurance and methodologies.  I also developed automated update procedures to incorporate future data and provided advice and recommendations on subsequent data collections.

### Client: The School for Social Entrepreneurs (SSE), London, UK

### Project: Data Management Solution & On-going Support

*March 2019 – Present*

This project delivered a bespoke data warehouse and business intelligence system to realise the potential of SSE's data for evidencing its impact and managing its work.   Based on a review of existing data and business process and a detailed analysis of requirements, we implemented a cloud-based, serverless warehouse solution which automates data flows from multiple sources into a flexible, but standardised structure for analytics.  Microsoft PowerBI was deployed to roll out dashboards, reports and analysis across the organisation.

The project also included an overhaul of the organisation's programme monitoring processes, including new tools which automated processes and integrated with various platforms to collect data from programme participants and facilitate management of the overall system.

Throughout the development and beyond, the client received ongoing support and capability for monitoring, reporting and analysis.
